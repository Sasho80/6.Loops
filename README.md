Loops
=====
Problem 1.	Numbers from 1 to N
Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n, on a single line, separated by a space. 


Problem 2.	Numbers Not Divisible by 3 and 7
Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n not divisible by 3 and 7, on a single line, separated by a space. 


Problem 3.	Min, Max, Sum and Average of N Numbers
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of n integer numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point). The input starts by the number n (alone in a line) followed by n lines, each holding an integer number. 


Problem 4.	Print a Deck of 52 Cards
Write a program that generates and prints all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (like 5♠, A♥, 9♣ and K♦). The card faces should start from 2 to A. Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Use 2 nested for-loops and a switch-case statement.


Problem 5.	Calculate 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + … + N!/XN
Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers n and x, calculates the sum S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + … + n!/xn. Use only one loop. Print the result with 5 digits after the decimal point.


Problem 6.	Calculate N! / K!
Write a program that calculates n! / k! for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Use only one loop. 


Problem 7.	Calculate N! / (K! * (N-K)!)
In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose k different members out of a group of n different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: n! / (k! * (n-k)!) 
  
For example, there are 2598960 ways to withdraw 5 cards out of a standard deck of 52 cards. Your task is to write a program that calculates n! / (k! * (n-k)!) for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Try to use only two loops. 


Problem 8.	Catalan Numbers
In combinatorics, the Catalan numbers are calculated by the following formula:
  
Write a program to calculate the nth Catalan number by given n (1 < n < 100).


Problem 9.	Matrix of Numbers
Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a matrix like in the examples below. Use two nested loops. Examples:


Problem 10.	Odd and Even Product
You are given n integers (given in a single line, separated by a space). Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements. Elements are counted from 1 to n, so the first element is odd, the second is even, etc. 


Problem 11.	Random Numbers in Given Range
Write a program that enters 3 integers n, min and max (min ≤ max) and prints n random numbers in the range [min...max].
